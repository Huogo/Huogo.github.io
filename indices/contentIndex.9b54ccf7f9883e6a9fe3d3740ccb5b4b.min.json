If you're interested in hiring me, or are recruiting here's a link to my general [CV](Portfolio\\CV.md) and my [current resume](Portfolio\\Files\\08-04-25%20Resume.pdf), below are also links to my portfolio.\n\n## Me in 10 seconds\n\nI like to describe myself as a professional problem-solver. I am deeply curious about the world around me and I love trying to tackle problems I've never solved before. I've been playing video games nearly all my life, the medium of games is my favorite art-form: [Games I've Played](Portfolio\\Games%20I've%20Played.md)\n\n## Me in 10 minutes\n\nRead my [About Me](Portfolio\\About%20Me.md)\n\n## Current Direction?\n\nCheck out my [Now](Portfolio\\Now.md) page\n\n# Portfolio Preview\n\nTake a look at my [Portfolio](Portfolio\\Portfolio.md) here or select one of the games I've been credited on.\n![256](Portfolio\\Files\\Helldivers2HomeImage.png)![256](Portfolio\\Files\\Payday3HomeImage.png)[Helldivers 2](Portfolio\\Portfolio.md#helldivers-2)[Payday 3](Portfolio\\Portfolio.md#payday-3)\n![256](Portfolio\\Files\\ImmortalsHomeImage.png)![256](Portfolio\\Files\\AlienRogueIncursionHomeImage.png)\n[Immortals of Aveum](Portfolio\\Portfolio.md#immortals-of-aveum)[Alien: Rogue Incursion](Portfolio\\Portfolio.md#alien-rogue-incursion)\n","lastmodified":"2025-08-04T23:43:41.3340465-04:00","tags":[]},"/Portfolio/About-Me":{"title":"About Me","content":"\n# Welcome\n\nI tried looking through many \"About\" sections to figure out ideas for what to write here. I ultimately came to the conclusion that it was more important for me to stumble through this myself. Those imperfections are part of me too after all. Rather than some form of curriculum vitae, I also prefer to structure this page as a focus on my ideals. If you did come here looking for a generalized CV about me, that's [here](CV.md)\n\n# \"Figuring it out\"\n\nAll of my work professionally could be loosely described as \"figure it out\", I like to broadly tell people that I'm a \"professional problem-solver\". \n\nIn reality that's all any of us are, we have expertise and solve the problems that others cannot. I pride myself on being a Generalist, a \"Swiss Army Knife\", as described by my previous managers and mentors.\n\nSo far I've been a:\n\n* Bench Technician - Repairing, Building, and Modifying Hardware\n* Software Engineer - Working with decompiled applications to rebuild source\n* Lead Game Content Developer - Owner of all the technical aspects of a biz dev strike team\n* Technical Designer (IC) - Building Tools \u0026 Solutions supporting teams for the studio\n* Senior Technical Artist - Building Tools, Accelerating Pipelines, Managing Features, and Optimizing Art \u0026 Gameplay systems\n* Mentor \u0026 Teacher - Aiding students along their journey to becoming or adopting the knowledge of Tech Art \u0026 Tech Design\n\n# Remain Deeply Curious\n\nI have a tendency to wander down extensive rabbit holes and get lost for a short while. Maybe it's how someone expresses their ideas and opinions, a historical recounting of role-playing games, or a technical discussion about rendering. I often come away from these brimming with ideas, so when I find a new focus it is often very exciting.\n\n# Fundamentals Are Key\n\nEvery field of expertise has a set of fundamentals that they rely on. The way we demonstrate our expertise to each other, is through demonstrations of these fundamentals. Art / Design / Programming all have their best/worst practices. As I have diversified my knowledge I've come to realize that many of these fundamentals can be \"self-similar\", the same idea in a different field.\n\nIn the current ecosystem of game development, many developers are \"trapped\" in their Engine of choice. I am of the opinion that if you learn the fundamentals, you can take that knowledge to any game engine, any other tool for creation, and achieve similar results.\n\n# I Love the Medium of Games\n\nThis medium, for me, is an accumulation of all other art forms. In some way any art form can find its way into the space of Games. I've been making \"games\" for as long as I can remember, but professionally it's been 10 years as of writing this.\n\nI'm constantly playing, making, analyzing, and exploring other analyses for games. Whether those are insights from professionals or an essay from a passionate player, I think the voices are important to hear. It's also important to form your own opinions though, you cannot create strong art without a voice of your own.\n\n# Remember to Have Fun\n\nHave fun, be goofy, try to not let the seriousness of life drag you down too much.\n","lastmodified":"2025-08-04T23:43:41.3075181-04:00","tags":[]},"/Portfolio/Archive":{"title":"Archive","content":"\n# Cubic\n\n## Studio\n\n### Team Training\n\n* Data Driven

Distance Fields","content":"\n# Intro\n\nMy recent focus of late (Summer 2023) has been all about the various implementations and usages of Signed Distance Fields or SDFs. There is so much to cover just in their applications for Game Development, but they're used in so many other fields too. Focusing my attention a bit though I've been working to smooth out the process of adoption for SDFs in work projects for myriad reasons. I've mostly focused on the 2D applications, but I am working toward 3D implementations in Unreal as well. Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) are shapes described with mathematical expressions. They provide information about the distance from any point in space to the nearest surface of the shape, positive values are outside the shape and negative values are inside the shape. \n\n# 2D Usages\n\nSDFs are a great tool for optimized texture rendering demonstrated in a [paper](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf) Valve submitted to SIGGRAPH 2007 where they revealed that they could utilize highly compressed textures to display the same content in their games with Alpha Testing. Now-a-days with even stronger computer hardware we can leverage Alpha Blending techniques to create higher quality renders. This technique alone allows teams to significantly reduce texture memory costs but SDFs also offer additional features. You can easily create several effects such as outlines, glows, drop shadows, and sharp corners. For SDF shapes you can easily round corners, make them annular, and perform union, subtraction, and intersection operations with little additional overhead. Building an optimized basis for things such as UI elements and their special effects without the need for texture sampling.\n\n![SDFBoxNormal](..\\Files\\SDFBox.png)![SDFBoxABS](..\\Files\\ABS_SDFBox.png)\n\n# 3D Usages\n\n2D applications are also only scratching the surface of the power of SDFs, they also play many roles in 3D. Unreal Engine builds Distance Fields for levels that can be utilized to detect collisions, SDFs are also used in Ray Tracing calculations. For example, Lumen's Software Ray Tracing for Global Illumination and Reflections are possible because of them. SDFs can be leveraged for Mesh Generation with voxel data, they also support geometry manipulations similar to the 2D counterparts like union, subtraction, and intersections. They are also useful for LOD management, Animations, and Distance-based Effects such as ambient occlusion, soft shadows, field based effects (like force-fields), and fluid simulations. A lot of this I'm sharing from my research, but I definitely want to see what I can put together knowing more about these applications.\n\n# Inspiration \u0026 Resources\n\nMartin Donald is a Senior Technical Artist at Ubisoft Berlin, who builds tech demo YouTube content and is my original inspiration for learning about these techniques.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b5hIMqz_wM\n\nValve's paper from SIGGRAPH 2007.\nhttps://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf\n\nInigo Quilez has done a lot of work on Signed Distance Functions for various shapes both 2D and 3D as well as additional effects for them. Rounding, Annularity, Onion, Union, Subtraction, and Intersections.\nhttps://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/\n\nEpic's UI/UX team from Fortnite also did a demonstration utilizing SDFs and provided several functions for building UIs from these various shapes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaHlhkmVDoI\n\nYouTube creator Kishimisu did some work introducing some circle SDFs creating some interesting and beautiful patterns.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4s1h2YETNY\n","lastmodified":"2025-08-04T23:43:41.2649579-04:00","tags":[]},"/Portfolio/Blog/Technology/Site-Notes":{"title":"Site Notes","content":"\n## How was it put together?\n\n### Inspirations \u0026 Learning\n\n* Search for a Free Alternative to Host my Notes\n* Bear Blog\n* Wiki.js\n* Tiddlywiki\n* Notion\n* Obsidian Publish\n* Brandon Boswell\n  * [Publishing your Obsidian Vault Online for Free with Quartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITiiuBNVue0)\n  * [Blog Post Write-Up](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz)\n    * Control how to only publish specific folder(s)\n  * @ On Mac so I needed to convert to Windows \u0026 Powershell\n* jackyzha0\n  * Quartz\n  * hugo-obsidian\n  * @ localhost\n* obsidian-export\n* @ Further inspiration was Derek Sivers' [Technical Independence](https://sive.rs/ti) post\n  * In the future I'd like to move away from even these, but for now, it's a solved problem.\n* For the original bash scripts\n  * Activated Virtualization\n  * Activated Windows Feature Virtualization\n  * Installed Ubuntu\n  * Needed to install Hugo, Go, and Rust\n  * obsidian-export expects Windows style file paths\n  * Setup the Ignore File\n  * Compile / Recompile\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* Git\n* HUGO\n* Install Go\n* Chocolatey\n* Dart Sass\n* Quartz\n* Hugo-Obsidian\n* Install Rust\n* Obsidian-Export\n\n### Scripts\n\n* Compile\n* Copy\n* Commit (Push)\n","lastmodified":"2025-08-04T23:43:41.2649579-04:00","tags":[]},"/Portfolio/CV":{"title":"CV","content":"\n* Spring 2010 Graduated High School\n* June 2014 Freelance Software Engineer with AGame Marketing\n* Spring 2015 Graduated College with a BA in Digital Media specialized Game Design\n* Feb. 29 2016 Started at Cubic on the Biz Dev strike team\n* Nov. 2018 Biz Dev strike team absorbed into Studio Team\n* Mar 2022 Left Cubic and Joined TLM Partners\n* Mar 2022 Started on Sensorium Project\n* April 2022 Moved to Alien: Rogue Incursion Project\n* ? 2022 Moved to Immortals of Aveum Project\n* ? 2022 Became part of the Hiring Process for TLM\n* Aug. 2023 TLM Partners acquired by Endava forming Endava Games Division\n* \n* June 2024 TLM Partners fully converted internally to Endava Employees\n* July 2025 Endava moves away from Core Video Game Development\n","lastmodified":"2025-08-04T23:43:41.3090225-04:00","tags":[]},"/Portfolio/Contributions/CG-Spectrum/Lesson-Building-Materials-Proceduralism":{"title":"Lesson Building -

Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff). I really liked the idea of having a localized space to talk about what's going on currently. A reminder to oneself \u0026 a public declaration of priorities, an endeavor to increase accountability. There are so many things demanding everyone's attention, so I have been working to make my attention more intentional. Maybe someone else will read this and be inspired by the same notions.\n\n## Life\n\n### Soon to be Married\n\n* Embarking on the most powerful and exciting adventure I've encountered yet!\n\n## Work\n\n### Current Employment\n\n* I'm currently employed by TLM Partners (an Endava Company) as a Technical Artist.\n* Supporting CG Spectrum in building content for Technical Artists.\n\n## Goals\n\n### Interested in Starting a Game Studio\n\n* Personal Worldbuilding Project\n* Inspiring People to Create\n* Supporting the Creative Endeavors of Others\n\n### Teaching People Skill Diversity\n\n* Art Fundamentals\n* Art as Math\n* Everything is Data\n","lastmodified":"2025-08-04T23:43:41.3080202-04:00","tags":[]},"/Portfolio/Portfolio":{"title":"Portfolio","content":"\n# TLM / Endava\n\n## Helldivers 2\n\n![Portfolio/Files/Helldivers2Banner.png](Files\\Helldivers2Banner.png)\nWhen I joined this project I was initially tasked with \"Improving the Armor Pipeline\". I started by digging through all the documentation they had written regarding the pipeline itself. I did a couple shadow sessions and interviewed artists about what the pain points and slow parts of the process were. In many cases comments led to 2 places, issues with the Stingray Engine, and needing to modify many, many text files.\n\n* Responsibilities\n  * Improve the Armor Implementation Pipeline\n    * Documentation \u0026 Clarifying Process\n    * Engine Modification Improving Workflows\n    * Pitches for Pipeline Improvements\n    * Extending Python Tools\n    * Troubleshooting Implementation for Artists\n  * Improve Bulletpainting System\n    * Optimized to support more units, larger units, and maintain texel density\n    * Documented process for Technical Artists \u0026 Artists to better maintain in the future\n    * Troubleshooting for Artists\n  * Optimize Uber Customization Shaders\n  * Develop Feature for Minimap\n* Additional Contributions\n  * Feedback \u0026 Improvement of Onboarding Process \u0026 Documentation\n  * Mentor New / Junior Team Members\n\n---\n\n## Payday 3\n\n![Portfolio/Files/Payday3Banner.png](Files\\Payday3Banner.png)\nThe team was initially hired to implement VOIP for the game, I joined months after work had started \u0026 helped get the first version(s) of VOIP working on PC. I also supported efforts to integrate PlayStation and XBOX. The contract continued into an implementation of the Server Browser, where I had ownership of implementing the design. After estimating the time it would take, we needed to complete the task sooner \u0026 I took on delegating work between team members based on dependency \u0026 design restrictions.\n\n* Responsibilities\n  * Implement UI Elements for VOIP\n  * Implement Server Browser UI\n  * Ensure UI meets Sony TRC Compliance\n* Additional Contributions\n  * Support Integration with Epic Online Services\n  * Troubleshoot Server Authentication \u0026 Tokens from Steam \u0026 PSN\n  * VOIP\n    * Troubleshoot VOIP Logic\n    * Add Features from Backend to Frontend\n  * Ownership of Server Browser UI\n    * Delegation to Team Members\n\n---\n\n## NDA Project\n\nWe were working on a game that was ported to Mobile \u0026 tasked with taking the Mobile port \u0026 porting that to Console. We were not allowed to modify the existing UI and the client did not want to maintain 2 separate UI versions. So in order to facilitate the UI we worked on developing a \"Console Wrapper\" that made the UI feel intuitive with a Controller.\n\n* Responsibilities\n  * Map UI \u0026 Player Interactions start to end\n    * Build out the scope of work\n    * Ensure we were not overlooking implementation details\n    * Identify Stability Issues in UI\n  * Implementation of UI Features\n  * Partial Design of UI/UX Features\n* Additional Contributions\n  * Developed Demos \u0026 Prototypes for how we could tackle the problem without being intrusive to the client code or UI\n  * Aided in the System Design of Input Handling System\n  * Aided in Educating Client's team on Unreal UI best practices for Implementation \u0026 Rendering\n  * Developed a Localization Solution for the Team to Improve Work Speed\n\n---\n\n## Immortals of Aveum\n\n![Portfolio/Files/ImmortalsOfAveumBanner.png](Files\\ImmortalsOfAveumBanner.png)\nA First-Person Magic Shooter I joined this project as a Technical Artist with the aim of optimizing their Animation Blueprints. Adjusting all the animations to follow Unreal's \"fast path\" system that supports multi-threading of animations. I was also tasked with fixing character Control Rigs \u0026 the integration of Control Rig into Animation Blueprints.\n\n* Responsibilities\n  * Implement Fast Path for Animation Blueprints\n  * Fix and Optimize Control Rigs\n  * Integrate VFX into Cinematics\n  * Optimize Physics \u0026 Collision\n  * Implement Progression Based Skeletal Mesh Swap\n* Additional Contributions\n  * Identified specific bug locations in code \u0026 offer solutions\n    * Because of my Tech Art title I wasn't allowed to directly contribute to code\n  * Took additional Post-Process Animation work off an overloaded Technical Artist's plate\n\n---\n\n## Alien: Rogue Incursion\n\n![Portfolio/Files/AlienRogueIncursionBanner.png](Files\\AlienRogueIncursionBanner.png)\nThis is a VR Alien game and my team was tasked with helping develop the puzzle mini-games initially. After nailing these down we started diversifying the systems we supported. Synth animations and dismemberment as well as weapon combat features. I worked on the implementation for the Smart Gun, auto-targeting, and turret functionality while supporting the development of the Flamethrower and Synth dismemberment.\n\n* Responsibilities\n  * Design and Implement Logic Puzzles\n  * Support Development of other Puzzle Mini-Games\n  * Implement the Smart Gun Features\n* Additional Contributions\n  * Supported Implementation of the Flamethrower\n  * Developed a Tool for Modifying \"Motherboard Components\" like Prefabs\n  * Developed a Tool for adding \"greebles\" to the Motherboard and filling space\n\n## Sensorium Galaxy\n\nI joined TLM in the middle of this contract for the initial creation of Sensorium Galaxy, developing a metaverse concept for Virtual Shows. I inherited and built on a system for mapping video as a form of LUT to individual stage pieces. I built a tool that enabled artists to visualize how the video was being divided, what each mesh was assigned, and enabled the easy assignment of new video sections to meshes in the scene.\n\n* Responsibilities\n  * Design \u0026 Implement a solution for streaming small 256x256 video(s) as stage VFX\n  * Develop a content tool for artists to easily map the video(s) to scene meshes\n  * Request specific UV layouts for meshes to support specific VFX\n\n# Archive\n\nIf you're interested in going back to my older work to understand more about my career and journey feel free to explore my archive.
